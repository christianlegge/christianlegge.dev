Years ago I used to stream regularly on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv), and I got the idea to use a chatbot to add some fun things to my stream like chat commands and song requests. There are existing bots you can download and use, of course, but I liked the idea of writing one myself.

I forked a repository called [twitchat](https://github.com/chhopsky/twitchat), which implemented the basics of connecting to the Twitch API and sending/receiving chat messages. That repository was a fantastic jumping-off point for my code, as I was pretty inexperienced then and would have struggled to write it on my own. My experience with this bot is a large part of why I believe in the benefits of open source when it comes to learning to code.
