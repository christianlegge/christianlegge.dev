Cojiro is a web app intended to simulate playthroughs of [Ocarina of Time Randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com), a game which randomizes the locations of items in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Players feel that the practice helps them make better routing decisions, which is helpful when competing in races.

It is a rewrite of a previous project called ZOoTR Sim, which was similar in concept but was played solely by clicking text links. Cojiro is a green-field rewrite of that project using NextJS and React. The website is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and the database is a Postgres one hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app).
