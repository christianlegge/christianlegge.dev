I've participated in a few game jams, which are events where entrants are given a theme and have a limited amount of time (usually 3&ndash;7 days) to make a small prototype for a game based on the theme.

[Moonshot](https://scatter.itch.io/moonshot) was made in Unity in January 2020. You play as an astronaut who has to mine rocks to collect fuel pellets. The player has to be watchful of their oxygen level which depletes over time. You can extract oxygen from the rocks, but that depletes their fuel supply. You have to fight off aliens using your flamethrower, too&mdash;which uses up tons of oxygen!

[Inside](https://scatter.itch.io/inside) is more of a tech demo than a game, but my idea was a mountain climber who can stomp on the ground to make the snow and ice fall away. It was programmed using Godot in April 2020.

[Dice n' Slice](https://scatter.itch.io/dice-n-slice) is a dungeon crawler where the rolls of the dice help you fight your enemies. The dice can boost your attack, your defense, or heal you, and Yahtzee-like hold-and-reroll mechanics let you have more control over your outcome.
