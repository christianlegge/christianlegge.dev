What kind of open source advocate would I be if I didn't contribute to others' projects? One of the best things about open source is when a capable dev sees a bug or a possible improvement they can take responsibility and fix it themselves. And I've done so many times! Here are some examples:

- [ALttP Randomizer: Add a feature that lets users select custom enemy drops for their games](https://github.com/sporchia/alttp_vt_randomizer/pull/440)
- [OoT Randomizer: Add a feature that lets users randomize the background music across different areas of the game](https://github.com/OoTRandomizer/OoT-Randomizer/pull/64)
- [Jellyfin: Fix a bug in which videos were finishing early due to an INT_MAX error](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-roku/pull/381)
- [RuneLite Quest Helper: Add a new quest to the helper, including internal values for progress and in-game instructions to help players](https://github.com/Zoinkwiz/quest-helper/pull/845)

I have lots more, but they're mostly just simple bug fixes and whatnot. To see them, search `is:pr author:christianlegge archived:false is:closed` on [github.com/pulls](https://github.com/pulls) (you must be signed in to see the page).
