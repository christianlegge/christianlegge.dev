The website you are currently on was built from scratch, by me ([as much as anything can be built from scratch, anyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)). I used [Astro](https://astro.build/), a fast web framework primarily intended for static site generation.

I've designed the website to be as mobile-friendly as possible, and it employs a responsive design.

I designed it myself and implemented the design using Tailwind CSS. I don't claim to be a web designer but I think it looks alright. I also built the blog system myself using Astro's built in Markdown rendering tools. The website is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app).
