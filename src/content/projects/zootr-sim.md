ZOoTR Sim is, I'm proud to say, a much worse version of [Cojiro](https://cojiro.app). I initially wrote it using AngularJS and hosted it on Amazon S3 as a static site. When I needed backend (to obscure an internal API key the site had grown to use), I added Node and Express and moved hosting to Amazon EC2.

I started working on ZOoTR Sim in 2018 and the codebase grew unwieldy over the years. By the time I felt like I had the skills to do it, I was excited to begin the rewrite that eventually became Cojiro. I learned a lot about web development from my years working on this project but I never want to look at it again.
