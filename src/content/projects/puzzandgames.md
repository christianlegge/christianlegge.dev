I write crossword puzzles! This really doesn't have much to do with coding&mdash;you could argue that making puzzles engages the same part of your brain as programming, and I think that's true to an extent, but really this is just here because I'm proud of them. A lot of these puzzles are kind of niche and will be pretty hard to solve for people not "into" crossword puzzles already, but I would feel bad leaving them off of here.

I'd like to move them onto this website someday, mainly so I don't have to pay for two domain names. Well, I guess Blogspot works too.
