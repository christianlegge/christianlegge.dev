_Alright fellas, keep it light._

I'm a Blue Jays fan. In my defense, it's been hard not to be; the doomed Cinderella run we just witnessed had much of the baseball-loving world in their corner, and a lot of the rest of it, too. But while I'm relatively new to the sport, you'd struggle to call me a bandwagoner. The first game I attended live was their brutal 2022 ALWC elimination game with the Seattle Mariners in which they secured an 8–1 lead and, due in part to a drastically mistimed pitching decision by John Schneider, proceeded to erode it over the course of the game while the energy in the stadium dissipated. If you're not in the know, you might assume my reaction to that would be to say "well, that sucked" and go on with my life. But baseball is a sport for perverts, and, lacking anything in my life that served only to make me feel bad, I was in.

Others have spoken far better than I could about why baseball is particularly grueling to watch, so I won't belabour it, but nothing is a given in this sport. No lead is insurmountable by any stretch and it's impossible not to be acutely aware of this fact while watching a game. If you're losing, each of your team's at-bats becomes a tense moment in which they need to either show up or die trying. If you're winning, you're holding your breath as your reliever takes the mound, hoping they don't blow it. It isn't just standard sports fan pessimism that makes baseball so painful—it's in the game's DNA.

And so it would follow, then, that watching your favourite team make a completely unexpected postseason run would be approached with the same mindset. To start, the baseball season is like a frog being boiled. 162 games is far too many for any individual one to indicate a pattern, so you take it as it comes, week to week, month to month, until you finally poke your head out of the water and realize what's been going on. The same team that sucked shit in April and May was suddenly winning the division and you're not really sure how. You can't remember a moment when it flipped, so in a way it feels like it never flipped at all. The Blue Jays were underdogs going into this season and they were underdogs coming out: even though they eked out a division win over the Yankees in Game 162, one of their best players was on the IL and their roster was not exactly stacked with power to begin with. One of their starting pitchers, Trey Yesavage, started this season in _High-A_ and made his _eighth overall MLB start_ **_in the World Series_**. Storybook season was an understatement.

If you're like me—and if you're reading this, you probably are, at least in this way—your brain has, somewhere, a constant low hum that tells you how fucked up the world is. Not depression or anxiety, not anything like that, just tacit awareness of the fact that the power structures in our society are unjust, climate crisis is inevitable, and both of those problems are growing worse by the hour. You live your life just fine; baseball, in fact, is one of many ways to enjoy yourself despite it, but you still _know_ these things. It is the lens by which you necessarily view everything else, and when a team like the Dodgers comes along, you notice. You notice that their payroll is the largest in the sport. You notice that they were able to pay\* $700 million\*\* for the best player on Earth and he got them to win the World Series twice. You notice that their parking lot is the size of 11 stadiums and you notice that each one of their games is attended by a slew of disgustingly rich celebrities who happen to live nearby.

Look, the Dodgers themselves are basically fine. Shohei Ohtani, in spite of everything, is one of the most likable people to ever play the game, God damn him. And I don't have anything against the rest of them either, except Kershaw or any of the others who may have loud, horrible opinions I don't currently know about. The problem with the Dodgers—beating the Jays notwithstanding—is solely what they represent. And above all, when they're playing the only Canadian team in America's Pastime, they represent the United States. I'm not too proud to admit that I felt like Canada's team winning the Fall Classic at a time when America is accelerating toward fascism more than ever before would have meant something. Sure, there are many ways in which Canada isn't much better, but that's getting harder to argue by the day. It would have at least been symbolic.

The unknowable future is hard to fathom in times like these. I'm lucky that war and wildfire are things I only have to hear about rather than experience in my home, but patterns show that that's utterly unsustainable. It is, in my experience, impossible to truly feel deep down that nothing governs it all. I'm not a religious person, but you don't have to have an answer to the question "Why is this happening?" to _feel_ that an answer _must_ exist. That we were all born into this world that allows so much suffering, and that we're hurtling towards levels of it that most of us can't even imagine—we're just supposed to accept that we lucked into this? We got the short end of the existential stick and it's all for nothing? I don't think I can.

So with that bleak mindset undergirding your every thought, and nothing but time to agonize over the fact that, in the best case scenario, you're about to watch the most stressful baseball of your life for a month, you start to make connections. Jays media is replete with mottos like "Canada's team", "one country, one team" and even "bring it home"—which I have to admit makes a lot more sense for the Stanley Cup finals. Regardless, flipping between that and my Bluesky feed where I see another ICE squad kidnapping parents to leave their children in the street crying, you can't help but start to see this World Series as a microcosm of what's happening on this continent.

I realize this is all a little much. I really do, and not just in hindsight. But it all works out a little too well, doesn't it?

I think about jinxes. It's funny how much I believe in them. I would have told you it's silly, but nevertheless felt a pang of guilt speaking about the possibility that the Jays could have won it all. Silly, sure, but more than that, isn't that selfish? Even if there's some grand force in the universe that enforces Jinx Rules, how could I alone possibly affect it? Surely there are millions of other people talking about this each day, and just as many doing the exact same thing on the other side. Jinxes can't exist unless you invoke some sort of jinx solipsism, some reason that you and you alone are the person who can affect the outcome simply by speaking it aloud. Or else it's a spirit bomb situation, I guess, where your jinx decreases the chance of it happening by some miniscule amount, and everyone's jinxes are all added together. Either way it's plainly asinine, but a lot of people still feel it deep down.

The simplest explanation—that things are just happening and there's nothing more to it—doesn't track for me, either. I don't want to sound bitter (although, could you blame me?), but there are a million ways the Blue Jays "should" have won that World Series, showcasing a preternatural consistency in just barely coming up with a win; that is, until the moment when it mattered most. They took the ALCS and World Series to Game 7 and neither were blowouts. It was a postseason run decided almost entirely by close calls, and the odds of that happening in the way that it did seem so low that it's truly hard to believe, even having seen it play out.

It's hard to describe the way I felt after Game 7. I think "grief" is truly the best word. I barely slept that night and it was well into the next day before the pit in my stomach went away. It's still coming back in waves. I shouldn't care about sports this much. I've never cared about sports much at all, really. But this was different. I had attached so much extrinsic meaning to the result of this baseball season and I had deluded myself into believing that there was no other way things could possibly be. Of course the Blue Jays had to win, because that would be a sign, an undeniable sign from God or the universe or whatever else, that what was happening was wrong. That good triumphs over evil, that no matter how bad things look now that there is always a light and here is that light because America has lost at its own game despite throwing all the money in the world at it. The timing would not have been a coincidence.

So what, then, if that doesn't happen? That, grandiose and ill-fitting as it may seem, was what I was contending with, all at once with anger at Isaiah Kiner-Falefa for not taking more of a lead off of third. We must either live in a random, uncaring world in which nothing could ever matter, or we live in a world that wants to laugh in our face about how bad it is. And with the way that series went, it was laughing hard.

But, it's just baseball, right? Maybe God isn't about all that symbolism stuff, maybe he's just a fan. If that's the case, his allegiance is clear. And I want to get on his good side, so let me Pascal's Wager my way in there now: Blue Jays fan coming in peace. That was a hell of a series, could have gone either way. Heartbreaker but it was some damn good baseball. See you next season and congrats to the boys in blue. Amen.
